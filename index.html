    <p>Summer normally starts in late May or early June. Summer weather normally heats up to reach 25 to 30 degrees celsius (77 to 86 degrees fahrenheit) and there is not much humidity in the air. The nights are also much warmer, with that the water in both the sea and inland bodies warm to around 18 degrees celsius or higher, making night time swimming very popular. 
        From late July to early August, it never really gets dark in the country, but the further north you go the more midnight sun you get. </p>

    <p>Winter is a local favorite for Norwegians. From the middle of November until early January, the sun doesn't rise at all, or just briefly peaks out over the horizon, in most parts of Northern Norway. The weather is very cold and stormy. During this time you can witness the blue hour, which is the little bit of light they get during this time. After Christmas, 
        everyone's mood improves. Snowfall is heavier and more frequent, so although the days are still short, what little light there is is reflected off the snow, giving the impression of a much lighter environment.</p>

It’s like a celestial ballet of light dancing across the night sky,
         with a color palette of green, blue, and sometimes even pink and violet. </p>

    <p>Most have heard some part of Norse folklore, and it is a huge part of Norway’s culture. The Black Death wiped out a massive population of the Norwegian population, leaving them to struggle economically and politically. The clergymen were one of the few who could write and with their deaths, Norway folklore culture and literature were at a disadvantage; since it was 
        only shared orally. As the rest of Europe advanced, Norway folklore culture remained protected through the oral preservation of their stories, history, and traditions. 3 widely known creatures of Norse folklore are trolls, elves, and Nattmara.</p>
    <p> <b>Trolls </b> - The origin of the word ‘trolls’ is uncertain, they have occupied a large space in much different folklore. They are often depicted as being dim-witted and slow in Norway folklore culture, making it easy for the human in the story to win over them. Sometimes, they are greedy and hoard gold, other times they hide under bridges or in mountains and appear in
         different shapes or forms.</p>
    <p> <b>Elves</b> - Considered to be beautiful, magical beings, elves take on many shapes in Norwegian folklore. Sometimes they appear as women, sometimes as spirits. They are always pleasant and appealing looking and possess various kinds of magic. Often, in tales, a troll or giants fall in love with the elves. In Danish stories, they are often depicted as evil, who seduce
         men and lure them to their deaths.</p>
    <p> <b>Nattmara </b> - Often described as women with long black hair and nails, folklore dictates that these creatures can transform into different elements and torment those who wish to sleep. Though their description and the fact that they make it hard for their victim to breathe is startlingly familiar to the sleep paralysis demons recorded over time.</p>
